\section{Architecture}

Data hazards, control hazards, structural hazards.

The design of the processor is based on the architecture provided in Figure 5.1 \cite[p. 50]{compendium}.
It has been extended to support jumps, data forwarding, hazard detection and branch prediction.

\section{Implementation}

\subsection{Data Forwarding}
Often, instructions are dependent on data calculated in the instructions directly before it.
In a pipelined processor, values will sometimes not have been written back to a register at the time they are needed as operands in another instruction.
The simple solution to this problem would be to stall the processor for 1-2 cycles so that data is available when it is needed.
This is not an ideal solution, however, as it will render big parts of the pipelined unused at many times, seeing as the pattern of data dependencies between nearby instructions is rather common.
A better solution, and one that is not much more complicated to implement, is a dedicated data forwarding unit.

The data forwarding unit compares register destinations from the MEM and WB stages, with source registers in the EX stage.
We add a mux in front of both operands to the ALU in the EX stage, with signals from the data in the MEM and WB stages.
Control signals from the forwarding unit switch between regular input data read from the register file, data from the MEM stage and data from the WB stage.

In addition to forwarding from the MEM \& WB stages to the EX stage, we support forwarding from WB to the MEM stage.
This enables us to do fast memory copies, by executing a SW instruction the cycle directly following a LW.

\subsection {Hazard Detection}
The implemented data forwarding will not be able to handle all kinds of data hazards.
Specifically, an R-type instruction directly following a load instruction, where the load's destination register is one of the source registers of the R-type instruction, can not benefit from data forwarding.
This is because while the R-type instruction is in the execute stage, the load instruction is still only in the MEM stage, and the data will not be ready before the next cycle.

To work around this issue, a hazard detection unit will detect a load followed by a data-dependent instruction (this does not apply to store instructions, as data forwarding takes care of this case).
A stall flag is enabled when a load instruction is currently in its execute stage, while a dependent instruction is in the ID stage.
This causes the dependent instruction to remain in the ID stage for one extra cycle, while the load instruction progresses to the MEM stage.
To give the effect of a nop (an instruction which does not alter memory) between them, the control signals for the dependent instruction are set to zero for one cycle.
At the same time, the PC needs to stall for one cycle, so no instructions are skipped.
The next clock cycle, the instruction enters the execute stage.
Then, data will be loaded from memory, residing in the WB stage, where we have already implemented data forwarding to the EX stage.

\subsection{Branching}

This processor implements multiple branch-related improvements compared to a na√Øve pipelined datapath. These improvements allow for speculative execution of instructions, keeping the pipeline full at all times.

The improvements include:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item
    Moving branch decisions from the memory stage to the instruction decode stage, comparing register values in a dedicated equality unit.
    This allows for instant branches with no lost cycles when data hazards are absent.
  \item
    When operands are unavailable in the ID stage, one cannot decide whether to take the branch.
    By making an educated guess using a branch prediction unit (containing a two-bit predictor\todo{cite a two bit predictor explained somewhere else so we dont have to? Or should we explain it}) we can speculatively execute instructions, keeping the pipeline filled.
    If a branch is taken wrongly, only two pipeline stages have to be flushed, always netting an improvement over delayed branching.
\end{enumerate}

To allow for zero-downtime branching, the program counter allows for instant updates, implemented via an internal bypass straight through to the instruction memory.
This allows us to update the PC to the target branch address the same cycle we decide to branch, thereby having the branch-target instruction ready at the next clock cycle.

To correct for wrongly taken branches, all branch related signals (branch\_taken, control\_should\_branch, and branch\_pc\_not\_taken) are passed on through the pipeline.
In the MEM stage, when the branch operands actually have been compared, corrective action can be taken if the wrong choice was made.
If there was a choice to branch, and the branch taken signal and alu result zero flag differ, the branch was taken wrongly.
Pipeline stages ID and EX have to be flushed, as well as the pc reset to the address of the pc not taken (branch\_pc\_not\_taken).
Afterwards, execution resumes as normal, having lost only two cycles if the branch was predicted wrongly.

There are multiple ways to decide on which choice to predict.

This data is also fed back to the branch prediction unit, allowing the two bit predictor to learn from recent branch behaviour to give better predictions in the future.
