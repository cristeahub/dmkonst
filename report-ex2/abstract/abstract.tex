\vspace*{\fill}

This report presents a solution to the second assignment in the subject TDT4255 at NTNU.
It describes an implementation of a simple 5-stage pipelined processor supporting a subset of the MIPS instruction set.
Optimization techniques such as data forwarding and branch prediction, as well as automatic hazard detection have also been employed to increase its performance.
The processor has been successfully run on a Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA, and its accuracy has been confirmed with unit tests, as well as several complete test programs.
