\chapter{Conclusion}

The implemented processor satisfies all requirements given.
It includes several optimizations targeted towards keeping the pipeline full at all times,
resulting in a fairly performant system.

It was implemented in a structured, iterative approach, where the system passed several tests along the way, to confirm the introduction of new features.
The final clock speed ended at 62.38 MHz, which is somewhat lower than the clock speed of our previously implemented multi-cycle processor.
The performance is still far greater, however, due to its pipelined nature.

The assignment presented some challenges, especially when dealing with memory with one-cycle delay.
The pipelining itself, and the data forwarding turned out to be quite easy to implement after the steep learning curve of exercise 1.
