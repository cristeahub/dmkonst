\section{Requirements}
What was the point of this section again?

\section{Performance}
A branch predictor brings along quite the critical path, yadda yadda

\section{Energy Efficiency}

\section{The Work Process}
We decided to take a gradual approach to the assignment.
We first converted the processor from Assignment 1 into a processor with five pipeline stages, and modified the test program to have enough nops to remove all hazards.
With this implementation working, we could progress to add data forwarding, and observe that the test passed with significantly fewer nops required.
blah, balh, This approach let us test each new component's integration in the system before progressing to the new task, until finally the original test program ran to completion.

\section{Further Work}
Faster, better
