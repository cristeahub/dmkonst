\begin{enumerate}
  \item Our methodology: Rewrite system from Ex1 to use barriers, and combinatorial state.
  \item Extend RTL sketch from book with support for 2-cycle jumps.
  \item Test that the entire program works, simulating a multicycle architecture with the pipelined version by filling pipeline with nops after each 'real' instruction.
  \item Everything now works in the ghettoPipeline. Many issues were had with the assembler, as no testing suite was developed. Bugs had to be ironed out manually.
\end{enumerate}

Optimization: Move branch one step earlier. Might introduce longer critical path.
Delays: 4 nops on data dependencies. 3 nops on branch. 1 nop on jump.


Mandag - Christoffer:
Gikk igjennom hele RTL-en sakte og sikkert
\begin{enumerate}
    \item - Why does the shamt from IF/ID go straight to ALU\_CTRL in the RTL? Shouldn't it go to the ID/EX mem?
    \item - The RTL I started with looked a lot like the one in the compendium, but JMP isn't included there.
    A small intro to what parts make up the JMP would be awesome.
\end{enumerate}

Forwarding unit is a relatively easy component.
It's suppose to make a hotwire connection between a calculated value and where that value is needed.
Because it avoids writing to registers, up to several cycles can be saved.

The way this works is to have a unit that checks if the current calculated value's address in memory
is equal to that of the RD or RT of the next instruction.
If it is, a mux connecting the newly calculated value is changed to let the newly calculated value thru.

The forwarding unit recieved addresses as input, as well as a write signal from both
the EX/MEM and MEM/WB registers.
It releases control signals to the muxes that switch the input to the ALU.
These muxes are now extended to also get the immidiate value from both EX/MEM and MEM/WB.

After recieving the values the forwarding unit checks if the values just made should be used for the next
caclucations.
If yes, it gives the apropriate signals to the mux.
