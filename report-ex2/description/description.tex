Some description

SÃ¸ndag:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Our methodology: Rewrite system from Ex1 to use barriers, and combinatorial state.
  \item Extend RTL sketch from book with support for 2-cycle jumps.
  \item Test that the entire program works, simulating a multicycle architecture with the pipelined version by filling pipeline with nops after each 'real' instruction.
  \item Everything now works in the ghettoPipeline. Many issues were had with the assembler, as no testing suite was developed. Bugs had to be ironed out manually.
\end{enumerate}

Optimization: Move branch one step earlier. Might introduce longer critical path.
Delays: 4 nops on data dependencies. 3 nops on branch. 1 nop on jump.
