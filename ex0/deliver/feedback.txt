We are very satisfied with the ex0.
It is nice to have an easier project to work on while figuring out how VHDL and our tool chain works.

We did however encounter a problem with stack_machine_tb not working. It did not have an effect on the fgpa program working,
but it might have confused some groups. Just some more information about what tests to run would be great.
