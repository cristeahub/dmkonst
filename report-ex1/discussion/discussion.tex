```
Discussion: Discuss the assignment and your achievements.
You are free to critically assess your work â€“ what could have been done better, which way you would choose to go if given the same task again etc.
You can also provide feedback about the assignment itself.

Here comes discussion. How did we do?

\subsection{Performance}
Good.

\subsection{Energy Efficiency}
Decent.

\subsection{Further work}

There is still room for optimization, to further increase the clock speed.
Another interesting improvement would be to implement support for a wider range of the MIPS instruction set.
Having support for all the defined instructions, would for instance enable us to run all sorts of available MIPS programs on our processor.
