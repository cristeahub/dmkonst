\section{Discussion}

% Discussion: Discuss the assignment and your achievements.
% You are free to critically assess your work â€“ what could have been done better, which way you would choose to go if given the same task again etc.
% You can also provide feedback about the assignment itself.

% Here comes discussion. How did we do?

\subsection{Requirements}
All the requirements given in the exercise were met.
The processor implements a basic subset of the MIPS instruction set\cite[p.64]{compendium} as specified.
It has been tested on a top-level and each component is also tested in separation.
We have also successfully tested it on the FPGA using the hostcomm\cite{hostcomm} utility.

\subsection{Performance}
Good.

\subsection{Energy Efficiency}
Decent.

\subsection{Further work}

There is still room for optimization, to further increase the clock speed.
Another interesting improvement would be to implement support for a wider range of the MIPS instruction set.
Having support for all the defined instructions, would for instance enable us to run all sorts of available MIPS programs on our processor.
