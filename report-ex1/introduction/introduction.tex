\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

``
Introduction: introduces the task of the assignment and the challenges it brings.
Also, it gives a brief introduction to how the task was approached and in which way the solution was reached.

A single cycle processor requires each instruction to take exactly one cycle.
This means that each instruction's time is bound by the slowest instruction.

A multi cycle processor requires multiple cycles to execute an instruction.
Because of this the processor is not bound by the slowest instruction.
Complex instructions will use more cycles and still be slow, but less complex instructions will use fewer cycles.
The total time it takes to run less complex, but more common instructions will be lower.

\subsection{Requirements}
\label{subsec:req}
The assignment's main requirement is to make a multi cycle MIPS processor\cite[p.47]{compendium}.
A suggested architecture is given in Figure 4.1 \cite[p.45]{compendium}, which was recommended to use.
Some architectual units were given in the support files, which could be included in the final design.

The following part of the MIPS instruction set is implemented on the FPGA.

\begin{itemize}
    \item ALU instructions (ADD, SUB, SLT, AND, OR)
    \item Conditional Branch (BEZ)
    \item LOAD and STORE (LW, SW)
    \item Load Immediate (LDI)
    \item Jump Instruction (JMP)
\end{itemize}

Note: the {\bf LDI} (Load Immediate) instruction is not a part of the MIPS instruction set\footnote{Figure C.1 \cite[p.66]{compendium}}.
The {\bf LUI} (Load Upper Immediate) is the closest match.
This instruction loads the value into the upper 16 bits of the register.
The support files handed out already used this instruction.

The system is first tested and verified in software, before moving on to testing on hardware.
The testing of the system both in software and in hardware is detailed in section%\vref{sec:testing}.

\subsection{Challenges and procedure}

The assignment provides several tasks that needs solving, these are detailed in section%\vref{sec:tasks}.
One goal set for the assignment is making sure all code complies with the standard set forth by the toolmakers (need to reword toolmakers).

The assignment is tackled on a bottom-up approach.
After an initial top design each smaller part of the system is made.
These smaller parts is tested to make sure they work.
When all parts are working individually they are tested together.
