Things to write about

\begin{enumerate}
  \item
    Chip select on ram, power savings

  \item
    The war on Xilinx ISE. Learning experiences etschetera

  \item
    Block ram in Registers instead of flip-flops with gigantic muxes. The reason for this is that a hardware designer has to consider his platform, in this case the target was an FPGA, and not 'actual' hardware. FPGAs hate muxes , altho they might be better in real hardware. like -- insert explicitive here --.

  \item
    State machine is based on the multicycle mips architecture provided in lecture slides.

  \item
    Outsourcing ALU control values to vhdl ENUM as it is better than us to assign logic values!

  \item
    Reducing critical path to increase clock frequency. Worst path is instruction immediate -> alu latch B -> alu -> zero out -> PC write.


\end{enumerate}
