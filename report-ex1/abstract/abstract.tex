\label{sec:abstract}

This report presents a solution to the first assignment for the subject TDT4255 at NTNU.
A small multi cycle processor was written in VHDL for the Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA.
A subset of the MIPS instruction set was successfully implemented and ran on the FPGA.
The generated processors clock frequence far exceeds the defined 24 MHz on the FPGA.
