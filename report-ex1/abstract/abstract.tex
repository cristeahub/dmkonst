% TODO: Add our actual MHz from place&route simulation to the final sentence
\vspace*{\fill}
This report presents a solution to the first exercise for the subject TDT4255 at NTNU.
The main task is to implement a multi cycle processor written in VHDL for the Xilinx Spartan-6 FGPA.
In addition to succesfully implement the processor, a subset of MIPS was implemented.
The generated processor's clock requence far exceeds the defined 24 MHz on the FPGA.
