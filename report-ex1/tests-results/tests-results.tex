\section{Tests and Results}

% Results: presents the results: what has been successfully completed and what did not work.
% If any ways around it were found, provide them at this place. Every solution should be tested for its validity.
% This is the place where you will describe what kind of testing you have performed and what the outcome of your tests was.

\subsection{Performance}

Multiple 
Is it fast yet?

\subsection{Energy efficiency}

The multi cycle MIPS processor presented here is more power efficient than its single cycle counterparts.
Reuse of datapath elements during different parts of execution, as well as overlapping instruction execution provide area savings.
A short average-instruction execution time, as well as high maximum clock frequency (73.573MHz) reduces time to program completion and active power consumption.
The usage of dedicated FPGA resources such as block ram provides additional power savings over alternative implementations.

Generating post-place-and-route power data in Xilinx ISE give us a rough idea of what actual power consumption could look like \ref{tab:power-estimates}.
Xilinx considers these values inaccurate, but they can still be used to make ballpark estimates.
With these values, we could potentially calculate MIPS instructions for 5 full hours on a single coin cell battery (150 mah).

Power constumption on an actual FPGA with the deployed programming was not tested.

\subsection{VHDL Testbenches}

% TODO: some parts of this might be better suited for solution or discussion?
All tests are written in VHDL and simulated in ISim.
Each component has been tested and verified with a separate testbench.
The system as a whole has also been tested with a separate testbech.
The mindset for the testbenches is to not only provide valuable testing to see if the compontents work,
but also make sure to give valueable feedback to the programmer.

The results of the tests are shown in table \ref{tab:tests}.

\subsubsection{Top level testbench}

A top-level testbench was provided, so that we could confirm that the processor worked as the exercise had intended.
It consists of a test program which is loaded into instruction memory, as well as some initial data.

Here follows several screenshots from the test simulation, showing how different instruction types are executed in the implemented processor.
They show what state the processor is currently in, as well as the currently executing instruction.
The complete run of the toplevel testbench can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:tb_toplevel} in Appendix A.

\subsection{Testing on hardware}

% TODO: a series of steps need to be taken?
When testing on the actual hardware, a series of steps needs to be taken.
These steps are illustrated in figure \ref{fig:testing_on_fpga}.

Firstly a .bit file must be generated form Xilinx.
This file is then uploaded to the FPGA via the hostcomm utility.
Afterwards a simple program is made, or taken from the testbench for the processor.

The endianness of the hostcomm utility \cite{hostcomm} is different from the testbench.
Because of that a simple translator was written in python to change
the endianness of the sample program \cite{endian-change}.
This program made it possible to paste its output straight into hostcomm.

With the program in the hostcomm utility, one can upload it to the fpga.
A button in hostcomm runs the program and afterwards there is a possibility to read form the FPGA memory.

The content of the FPGA memory is then verified against expected output manually.
