\section{Tests and Results}

% Results: presents the results: what has been successfully completed and what did not work.
% If any ways around it were found, provide them at this place. Every solution should be tested for its validity.
% This is the place where you will describe what kind of testing you have performed and what the outcome of your tests was.

\subsection{Performance}

Is it fast yet?

\subsection{Energy efficiency}

How much power does it consume when running on the FPGA?

\subsection{Testbenches}

% TODO: some parts of this might be better suited for solution or discussion?
All tests are written in VHDL and simulated in ISim.
Each component has been tested and verified with a separate testbench.
The system as a whole has also been tested with a separate testbech.
The mindset for the testbenches is to not only provide valuable testing to see if the compontents work,
but also make sure to give valueable feedback to the programmer.

The results of the tests is shown in table \ref{tab:tests}.
