\section{Tests and Results}

% Results: presents the results: what has been successfully completed and what did not work.
% If any ways around it were found, provide them at this place. Every solution should be tested for its validity.
% This is the place where you will describe what kind of testing you have performed and what the outcome of your tests was.

\subsection{Performance}

Is it fast yet?

\subsection{Energy efficiency}

How much power does it consume when running on the FPGA?

\subsection{Testbenches}

Each component has been tested and verified with a separate testbench written in VHDL and simulated in ISim.
